Mailet is an unobservable transport proxy which enables the users to access social websites by email applications. Without assuming the Mailet servers are trustworthy, Mailet can support the services requiring privileges without having the complete credential.


How to use?

1. Send an Email with random content to an Mailet server 
2. Authorize by using the attached HTML page in the email response 
3. Access social websites by sending and receving emails.


Note: this version uses secure two-party computation to combine the credential. Since Twitter no longer supports RC4-SHA ciphersuite, this method can not be deployed. Still, this method is effective for other websites which support RC4-SHA, such as Facebook.
